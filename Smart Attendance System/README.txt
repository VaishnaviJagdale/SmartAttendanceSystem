The Smart Attendance System is a computer vision-based solution designed to automate the process of taking attendance in educational
institutions or any organization. It utilizes facial recognition technology to identify and record the presence of individuals in a 
database. The system then generates an Excel sheet containing the names of students or employees and their corresponding timestamps 
for attendance. Taking attendance manually can be a time-consuming and error-prone task. The Smart Attendance System aims to simplify 
this process by automating it through facial recognition technology. With this system, you can quickly and accurately record attendance, 
reduce administrative overhead, and maintain a digital record for future reference.
